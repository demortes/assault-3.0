This is the the Assault 3.0 as it was run by Demortes. This is open to the public, following the standard licenses of Ack and Assault as run by Amnon.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask me, although I, admittadly, will not always be the best resource.

The project is now abandoned and archived.
